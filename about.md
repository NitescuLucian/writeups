jmp 0xc0ffee is a CTF club organised by the [Security Espresso Bucharest](https://securityespresso.org) community.

## Learn with us!

Cyber security is an intersection of many IT fields and is often shrouded in mystery. Here at jmp 0xc0ffee we are trying to debunk myths and offer a possible approach in learning the art of exploitation.

During our sessions we will touch on a range of subjects including Cryptography, Web exploitation, Binary Reverse Engineering, Digital Forensics and many others! You can learn more in the events section.
